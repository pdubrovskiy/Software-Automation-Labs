# Fraction Class

## Overview

Define the class **Fraction** as a pair (m, n). The class should contain multiple constructors. Implement methods for:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Reduction of fractions

The methods for addition and multiplication should support a variable number of parameters.

## Array Operations

Declare an array of `k` fractions. Implement functionality to input and output values for the array of fractions.

## Advanced Operations

Create an array of objects and pass it to a method that modifies each element of the array with an even index by adding the next element of the array to it.
